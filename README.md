# Arduino-Color-Clock

This uses a modified RTClib library by Adafruit forked from JeeLab to add the day of the year function so the Stardate is in the correct format (2118.195) 
(Adafruit https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) (jeelabs https://jeelabs.org/pub/docs/rtclib/)
This uses the UCGLib library by olikraus (https://github.com/olikraus/ucglib) for the Color OLED
Clock contains battery percentage, Tempature, Time in 12 hour format and Stardate based off the new Star Trek movies.
This is a work in progress.
