# Arduino-Color-Clock

This uses a modified RTClib library by Adafruit forked from JeeLab to add the day of the year function so the Stardate is in the correct format (2118.195)
This uses the UCGLib library by olikraus (https://github.com/olikraus/ucglib) for the Color OLED
Clock contains battery percentage, Tempature, Time in 12 hour format and Stardate based off the new Star Trek movies.
This is a work in progress.

1. Add menu system
2. Add button control for menu
3. Add alarm saved to eprom
